# odin-testing-practice

## Overview
This project contains small JavaScript exercises focused on writing functions and testing them using **Jest**.  

### Exercises Completed
- **capitalize** – Capitalizes the first letter of a string.  
- **reverseString** – Reverses a given string.  
- **calculator** – Performs basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.  
- **caesarCipher** – Implements the Caesar cipher with:  
  - Letter shifting and wrap-around (`z` → `a`)  
  - Case preservation  
  - Punctuation and spaces unchanged  
- **analyzeArray** – Returns an object with `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length` for an array of numbers.

## What I Learned
Through these exercises, I gained:  

- ✅ Writing **unit tests** for functions and objects using Jest.  
- ✅ Implementing string manipulation algorithms (capitalization, reversing, Caesar cipher).  
- ✅ Handling **edge cases** like wrapping letters, preserving case, and ignoring punctuation.  
- ✅ Working with arrays to calculate **statistics** like average, min, max, and length.  
- ✅ Writing **clean, readable, and maintainable code**.  
- ✅ Practicing **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** by writing tests first and then making them pass.  

These exercises helped me strengthen both my **problem-solving skills** and **confidence in testing JavaScript code** effectively.
